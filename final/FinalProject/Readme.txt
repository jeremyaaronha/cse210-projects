My program generates different types of certificates, 
it has a main menu that has 4 options, the user choose the option by entering the number of the option, 
the first option is to generate a certificate, when choosing the first option the program 
displays new options in which the user must choose the type of certificate by entering the number 
of the option, in each one of the certificates the user will be asked to enter the information 
to complete the certificate, once the information is entered, the user will be asked to 
name the PDF file, and it will be created and saved. 
The second option is to see the information of the certificates that have been generated. 
The third option is to re-download a certificate that was previously generated, 
the user will simply be asked what they want to name the file. 
The fourth option is to exit the program.
